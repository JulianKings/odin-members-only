# Odin's members only
A basic exercise to practice authentication and everything we've done until now regarding Express and MongoDB.

The password to join the members club is 'yummyOranges'
There is also an administrator password to get admin rights.

You can configure your own environment variables like this:
MONGODB_URI=(your db connection string)
SECRET_PWD=(password to join the club)
ADMIN_SECRET_PWD=(password to become an administrator)
